    <h2 id="bh2">What is exactly "Floriography"?</h2>
    <p id="bp">Floriography, or language of flowers is a cryptic communication using flowers and their arrangement. <br> 
        Plants and flowers has been used symbolically for thousands of years, starting from the Hebrew Bible <br> 
        (buttercup, poppy, lavender, rockrose, violet, crocus), later famous poets and writers also used it, <br> 
        like William Shakespeare (1564-1616, the most known one in Hamlet, where Ophelia has her "talking" flowers).</p>

</p>
<p id="bp">Floriography and its craze was introduced to Europe by 2 people: Mary Wortley Montagu, who brought it to England (1717) <br> 
    and Aubry de La Mottraye who introduced it to the Swedish court (1727). <br>
The first publication about was Joseph Hammer-Purgstall’s Dictionnaire du languages des fleurs in 1809, <br> 
and the first dictionary was published 10 years later, in 1819 by Madame Charlotte de la Tour and was called Le langage des Fleurs.</p>

    <p id="bp">These publications were the most famous ones, the books that contained everything, from illustrations to poems. <br> 
        Next to them they published magazines about flowers and poetry, sometimes the two themes together, <br> 
        sometimes separately. These articles in some cases got included in the new editions of these books, <br> 
        or like in the case of Kirkland, as she was the editor of two Magazine, she wrote Poetry of Flowers <br>
        later in her life, collecting everything she saw and wrote during her working days with these magazines. <br> 
        This helped her book to reach 522 pages, which is one of the most comprehensive books about flowers and floriography.</p>
